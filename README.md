# Add-on Card Preview

This is a quick prototype to explore how a card preview for addons.mozilla.org
might work to be able to communicate planned changes around content lengths
to developers.

## Run locally

* Checkout the code
* `yarn install`
* `yarn start`

## Deployment is via heroku CLI and this assumes you have the branch setup:

* git push heroku master
